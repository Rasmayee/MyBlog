    <img src ="profile pic.png" alt ="Rasmayee profile picture">
    <p> I recently started interacting with dogs. I went to Texas to meet my cousins. We went on a road trip from Dallas to Oklohoma to adopt a beautiful soul. It's a Golden Doodle. We gave him a million names. But, my favourite is Ginger. I always held him in my arms and gave him belly rubs and kisses. We clicked many pictures together and also went on his first car drive to StarBucks. I loved playing with this naughty kid. Omg!! I'm a dog lover now. I want to have a dog of my own. </p>
